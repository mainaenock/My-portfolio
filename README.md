# My-portfolio
This is a project for my portfolio
These are the steps I got from chatGpt on how to build my portfolio website:

1. Plan Your Portfolio
Before you start coding, take time to plan:

    Identify Your Purpose – Is this portfolio for job applications, freelance work, or personal branding?

    Choose Sections – Common sections include:

    Home – A brief introduction with a headline.

    About Me – Your bio, skills, and background.

    Projects – A showcase of your best coding projects.

    Contact – A way for people to reach you (email, social media, or a contact form).

Sketch a Layout – You can use tools like Figma or draw it on paper.

2. Set Up Your Project Folder
Create a main folder (e.g., portfolio).

Inside, create three essential files:

    index.html – The main structure of your website.

    style.css – Styles your site to make it visually appealing.

    script.js – Adds interactivity (e.g., animations, form validation).

    Create an images/ folder to store profile pictures, project images, etc.

3. Build the HTML Structure
    Use HTML to create the sections and content layout.

    Include a navigation bar for easy movement between sections.

    Add semantic HTML elements like <header>, <section>, <footer>.

    Ensure the Projects section has links to GitHub repositories or live demos.

4. Style with CSS
    Apply a consistent color scheme (use tools like Coolors for inspiration).

    Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to structure your layout.

    Choose web-friendly fonts from Google Fonts.

    Add hover effects and animations to make it visually engaging.

5. Add JavaScript for Interactivity
    Add a welcome message or typing effect on the homepage.

    Create a dark/light mode toggle for better user experience.

    Implement form validation on the contact form.

    Add smooth scrolling for better navigation.

6. Make It Responsive
    Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

    Test responsiveness using Chrome DevTools (F12 → Toggle Device Toolbar).

    Optimize images to load faster on different devices.

7. Host Your Portfolio Online
    Choose a hosting platform:

    GitHub Pages (free, good for beginners).

    Netlify (fast and allows custom domains).

    Vercel (great for JavaScript-heavy projects).

    Hostinger, Bluehost, or Firebase (for professional hosting).

8. Keep Updating Your Portfolio
    Regularly add new projects to showcase growth.

    Update the About Me section with new skills.

    Improve the design by learning Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or animations.

    Optimize SEO so your portfolio appears in search results.
